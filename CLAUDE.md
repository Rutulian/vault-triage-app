# Vault Triage App

A web UI for processing messy Obsidian vaults with embedded AI chat.

## Project Overview

Read `docs/SPEC.md` for the full product specification.
Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical decisions (once created).

## Development Workflow

This project uses Vibe Kanban for task orchestration. Each task should:
1. Have clear acceptance criteria
2. Be completable in a single session
3. Include tests where appropriate
4. Update documentation as needed

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript** everywhere (strict mode)
- **ESLint + Prettier** for formatting
- **Conventional commits** (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Tests** for business logic (unit) and critical paths (integration)

## Architecture Principles

*To be documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` after Phase 0*

## Key Commands

```bash
# To be filled in after project setup
```

## Directory Structure

*To be documented after architecture phase*

## Current Phase

**Phase 0: Architecture & Planning**
- Decide tech stack
- Document architecture decisions
- Create project structure
- Set up development environment
